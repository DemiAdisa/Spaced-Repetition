# Introduction
This is a group project for The CS-3130 Mobile Development Course.  
The main idea of the project has been presented in the course but it is simply a study tool for students, making use of repetition to keep their memories intact.  
An APK of the built application can be found in the "Releases" tab of the repo.

The application makes use of the [Spaced Repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) concept to help students remember study materials better. I was responsible for the Frontend of the application during the course. It was developed using Dart, Firebase and Flutter.

# Please Note
Due to completion of the course and the disbandment of the group, the backend service for the application has been dissolved and this application is no longer viable. This is just the code for fututre referencing.
