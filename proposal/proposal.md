# Introduction
This is our group project for The CS 3130 Mobile dev Course.  
The main idea of the project has been presented in the course but it is simply a study tool for students, making used of repetition to keep their memories intact

# Basic Features
The basic features to be implemented are:  
- [ ] A Register Screen : This is a screen where our users can register themselves into our database to make use of the app.
- [ ] A Sign-In Screen : This is a screen where our users can sign in with their user-name and password.
- [ ] Set Questions Feature : The app runs around the idea that users create questions to test their knowledge, so at least, users need to be able to set a group of questions to put through the interval rate algorithm.
- [ ] Set Answers Feature : After setting a question, users will need to be able to set a corresponding answer to the question.
- [ ] Index Card Function : Each set of one(1) question and its corresponding answers can be written on one(1) index card. The "Set Question Feature" will be in the front of the card, followed by a set of answers in the back of the card.
- [ ] Interval Rate Algorithm : An algorithm that will govern the rate at which the questions will be presented to the users. It will also govern any constraints to answering the questions (e.g. Time Limits). Users will have a bit of choices in choosing what they would like the algorithm to implements (e.g. how long the timer will be).
- [ ] Reminder Function : Using Interval Rate Algorithm, notifications for the question will be given to the user during the chosen time interval. Reminder will stop after the time limit ends or restart if the user doesn't remember the answer or answers incorrectly.
- [ ] Answer Questions Feature : Users will need to be able to answer the question they have set, it will be in Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) format and the supplied answer will be cross referenced with the preset answers.


# Project Timeline
We will approach this in using a weekly .............

# External API Help
Since the questions would be provided by our users, we would not need to contact any external API to make this happen
