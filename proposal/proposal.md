# Introduction
This is our group project for The CS 3130 Mobile dev Course.  
The main idea of the project has been presented in the course but it is simply a stduy tool for students, mkaing used of repitition to keep their memories intact

# Basic Features
The basic features to be implemented are:  
- [ ] A Register Screen : This is a screen where our users can register themselves into our database to make use of the app.
- [ ] A Sign-In Screen : This is a screen where our users can sign in with their username and password.
- [ ] Set Questions Feature : The app runs around the idea that users create questions to test their knowledge, so at least, users need to be able to set a group of questions to put through the interval rate algorithm.
- [ ] Set Answers Feature : After setting a question, users will need to be able to set a corresponding answer to the question.
- [ ] Interval Rate Algorithm : An algorithm that will govern the rate at which the questions will be presented to the users. It will also govern any constraints to answering the questions (e.g. Time Limits). Useres will have a bit of choices in choosing what they would like the algorithm to implements (e.g. how long the timer will be).
- [ ] Answer Questions Feature : Users will need to be able to answer the question they have set, it will be in MCQ format and the supplied answer will be cross referenced with the pre-set answers.
